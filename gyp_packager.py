# This script is a wrapper for Packager that adds some support for how GYP
# is invoked by Packager.
#
# Build instructions:
#
# 1. Setup gyp: ./gyp_packager.py
#
# clang is not enabled by default, which can be enabled by overriding
# GYP_DEFINE environment variable, i.e. "GYP_DEFINES='clang=1
# use_openssl=1' ./gyp_packager.py".
#
# Ninja is the default build system. User can also change to make by
# overriding GYP_GENERATORS to make, i.e. "GYP_GENERATORS='make'
# ./gyp_packager.py".
#
# 2. The first step generates the make files but does not start the
# build process. Ninja is the default build system. Refer to Ninja
# manual on how to do the build.
#
# Common syntaxes: ninja -C out/{Debug/Release} [Module]
# Module is optional. If not specified, build everything.
#
# Step 1 is only required if there is any gyp file change. Otherwise, you
# may just run ninja.
