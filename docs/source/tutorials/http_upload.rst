    ðŸ›  Status: Work in progress

    The Shaka Packager HTTP upload feature is currently in development.
    It's on the fast track to a working alpha, so we encourage you to use
    it and give us some feedback. However, there are things that haven't
    been finalized yet so you can expect some changes.

    The discussion about this feature currently happens at
    `Add HTTP PUT output #149 <https://github.com/google/shaka-packager/issues/149>`_,
    its development on the
    `http-upload <https://github.com/3QSDN/shaka-packager/tree/http-upload>`_ branch,
    feel free to join us.


HTTP upload
===========

Introduction
------------
Shaka Packager can upload produced artefacts to a HTTP server using
POST, PUT and PATCH methods to improve live publishing performance
when content is not served directly from the packaging output location.

The produced artefacts are:

- HLS playlist files in M3U_ Format encoded with UTF-8 (.m3u8)
- Chunked audio segments encoded with AAC (.aac)
- Chunked video segments encapsulated into the
  `MPEG transport stream`_ container format (.ts)



Research
--------
We identified a few sensible ways of uploading files using HTTP.

1. HTTP POST

   Full upload only. Framing: HTML form / multipart stream. See `RFC 1867`_.

2. HTTP PUT

   Full upload only. Framing: None. See `RFC 2616 Â» PUT`_.

3. HTTP PUT with chunked transfer

   Incremental upload. Framing: Chunks. See `RFC 2616 Â» Chunked Transfer Coding`_.

4. HTTP PATCH with append

   Incremental upload. Framing: None. See `RFC 5789`_ plus ``Update-Range: append`` header.

5. HTTP2

   Is there anything special we should take care of?


Each method has different pros and cons regarding behavior, compatibility,
conveniency and efficiency. Note that while raw performance is in the main
focus, other aspects like idempotency, server-side constraints or which
mode would be suitable for live vs. non-live transmission might also be
relevant for choosing the transport method which fits your needs best.


Implementation
--------------
This section describes the current state of the implementation,
contributions are welcome.

The "HTTP PATCH with append" (4.) method has been implemented first, but the
"HTTP PUT with chunked transfer" (3.) method suggested by @colleenkhenry
and provided by @kqyang will be implemented, being an even better variant.
As @kqyang noted, this transport mode should be more efficient than
HTTP PATCH as only one HTTP connection needs to be setup.

All data will be declared as ``Content-Type: application/octet-stream``.


Drawbacks
---------
As ``File::file_name()`` returns the real file name with its scheme prefix
(file://, http://) stripped off already by ``File::CreateInternalFile()``
and ``File::GetFileTypeInfo``, the ``http_upload`` module currently can
not account for https.


Example
-------
Here is a basic example. It is similar to the "live" example and also
borrow features from "FFmpeg piping", see :doc:`live` and :doc:`ffmpeg_piping`.

Grab and run `httpd-reflector.py`_ to use it as a dummy HTTP sink::

    # Ready
    wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/amotl/3ed38e461af743aeeade5a5a106c1296/raw/httpd-reflector.py
    chmod +x httpd-reflector.py
    ./httpd-reflector.py --port 6767

Define UNIX pipe to connect ffmpeg with packager::

    export PIPE=/tmp/bigbuckbunny.fifo
    mkfifo ${PIPE}

Acquire and transcode RTMP stream::

    # Steady
    ffmpeg -fflags nobuffer -threads 0 -y \
        -i rtmp://184.72.239.149/vod/mp4:bigbuckbunny_450.mp4 \
        -pix_fmt yuv420p -vcodec libx264 -preset:v superfast -acodec aac \
        -f mpegts pipe: > ${PIPE}

Configure and run packager::

    # Define upload target
    export META_PATH=http://localhost:6767/hls-live/meta
    export DATA_PATH=http://localhost:6767/hls-live/media

    # Go
    packager \
        "input=${PIPE},stream=audio,segment_template=${DATA_PATH}/bigbuckbunny-audio-aac-\$Number%04d\$.aac,playlist_name=bigbuckbunny-audio.m3u8,hls_group_id=audio" \
        "input=${PIPE},stream=video,segment_template=${DATA_PATH}/bigbuckbunny-video-h264-450-\$Number%04d\$.ts,playlist_name=bigbuckbunny-video-450.m3u8" \
        --io_block_size 65536 --fragment_duration 2 --segment_duration 2 \
        --time_shift_buffer_depth 3600 --preserved_segments_outside_live_window 7200 \
        --hls_master_playlist_output "${META_PATH}/bigbuckbunny.m3u8" \
        --hls_playlist_type LIVE

Output
------
The terminal running ``httpd-reflector.py`` should display the payload chunks
arriving from ``packager``. It will be the expected mixture of playlist files
and media artefacts outlined above.
